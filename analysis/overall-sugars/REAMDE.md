Overal analysis of sugar properties

(Besides core calculations do in notebook

For a given parameter set:
-> Create table, fields:
	- Sugar name
	- Total compatible products
	- Minimal cover size


-> Create a second table of deletion frequency with:
ID | formula | counts_sugar1 | counts_sugar2 | ... | average counts

- Sort by average counts

-> Venn diagram of product compatibility among sugars,
are there unique cases?
- Discuss unique products


#  random notes:

- The xylose run seems to have errored out towards the end and population 47 is missing, this should not change the results much.

- Generate plot of compatibility distribution for each case
- Compare top reaction deletions in each case (and perhaps module reaction usage in each case)
- Compare (venn diagram) overlap of compatible products per/carbon source
- Present most compatible designs per carbon source or present minimal covers per carbon source? Most compatible is simpler, however it might look minimal covers seems uninstersting.
- We can alsso create a table of: sugar/compatible products/ most compatible design/ minimal cover size
- The compatibility figure can be extended to include all carbon sources
