Everything is the same as anaerobic case but with lower bound for oxygen uptake of -20

In this case the maximum growth rate predicted by the model is
0.8770
However, the minimum growth rate is determined under the premis that it is sufficient for growth. So if it is sufficient for anaerobic, it should also be for aerobic. Thus this value is not changed.
